NumberGame
==========


This is a partially completed game that is only text based currently. It is a game based of off 2048 where number
tiles will slide into eachother and if they are the same number they will add together and combine into one tile.
The difference is in this game the user picks a number tile (currently by entering row and column number) and all tiles
on that row and column will move towards the selected tile combining when possible. Each move another tile 2 or 4 is
randomly generated on the board.
